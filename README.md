# IRLS

This is the source code of the MP-assisted IRLS algorithm (termed IRLS) associated with our IEEE TVT paper:

W. Xiong, C. Schindelhauer, H. C. So and S. J. Rupitsch, "A Message Passing Based Iterative Algorithm for Robust TOA Positioning in Impulsive Noise," in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2022, doi: 10.1109/TVT.2022.3203487.

Note that the convergence criterion used here is a little bit different from the one adopted in the paper. Please check this for your implementation if necessary.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
